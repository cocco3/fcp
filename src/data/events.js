    WOOF! 2022 is here and this ALPHA we're hitting you with some sweet sweet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hunyrocks/">HUNY</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    ALPHA is ON for Saturday, March 19, 10pm-4am at Club Six. Upstairs coat check + lounge OPEN = more comfort & space downstairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    HUNY (Sarah Huny Young) is a DJ, event producer (Darkness is Spreading), creative director, and entertainment industry vet (VIBE, BET) with a Soul Train Award on her mantle via Soulbounce, an influential music platform which she formerly co-owned. So basically: HUNY extensively knows a good time and a good bop. Her sets are heavy on ballroom vogue beats, house, hip-hop, 90's R&B, and dancehall… but anything with a nasty beat, genre-aside, can get it, too. Residencies include Ace Hotel Pittsburgh's In the Weeds series, and day party pop-up venue ALL SUMMR.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're also offering our QTBIPOC rave family a reduced cost ticket should anyone need it. You can DM our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fogcitypack/">Instagram</a> for the code and let your friends know as well.

The Pack rounds out its triad of annual depravity back at Club Six on SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 10pm–4am. Upstairs Lounge Bar + Clothes Check by Pedal Pups. Downstairs for the classic dancefloor & deviance you've come to expect from Fog City Pack.

Featuring the incomparable [madison moore](https://www.madisonmooreonline.com/) ([soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/madison-alexander-moore)), artist-scholar & leader in Black queer nightlife. Born and raised in Ferguson, Missouri, madison moore is a polymath: a professor of gender studies, author of a New York Times celebrated book on fabulousness, and a burgeoning artist on the global queer techno scene. His sassy, energetic sets are known for bringing the flavors of hard techno, house, ghetto tech, vogue beats, disco and dub techno to the dance floor. After moving to London in 2014, madison quickly became a regular on the London scene and co-founded OPULENCE, a queer techno collective that was featured in Last Dance, a short film about London nightlife released by 4:3/Boiler Room. Since 2014, madison has played clubs in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Bristol, New York, and has shared the decks with the likes of Boris, Machine Woman, Samuel Kerridge, SPFDJ, Roy Perez and Object Blue. Fog City Pack is thrilled to bring him to San Francisco!

Fog City Pack celebrates 7 years of earthly delights with ALPHA on Saturday, February 25, 2023.

Unearth someone’s delicate flower, take a sniff and float off into a kinky eden—where the echoing primal sounds of Techno hypnotize and rouse you to dance all night long!

Featuring the San Francisco debut of [Sister Zo](https://ra.co/dj/sisterzo)

Kansas City-born, now based in Brooklyn Zoey Shopmaker, aka Sister Zo, has long been on a path entirely her own.

Starting out performing at underground poetry events in her hometown, she eventually moved on to playing live beat sets during open mic nights at one of KC's most pivotal queer nightlife institutions of the 21st century, the Uptown Arts Bar. There she got her first taste of the sounds of the UK bass continuum and the LA beat scene.

In October 2017, Sister Zo and her friends Mazzy Mann and Lorelei Kretsinger founded [UN/TUCK](https://www.instagram.com/untuckaudio/) the queer/trans collective and record label. Over the next two years, they tirelessly built UN/TUCK into an internationally recognized platform, releasing their own music and organizing shows and parties curated specifically for trans and queer people in Kansas City.

Sister Zo has made definitive creative statements in 2022, releasing her debut EP, Screw Cheek, on acclaimed UK club label, Scuffed Recordings, and a follow-up EP, Freak Shift, on Martyn's hallowed 3024 imprint. With bookings at clubs like Bunker NY, Texture Detroit, Sole Rehab, Nowadays, Good Room and Kremwerk; festivals like Slingshot and Honcho Campout with tracks and mixes that both seamlessly capture AND defy her genres of interest, it's clear that Sister Zo has firmly solidified her place as an emerging artist in her own right.

Also featuring residents [Astro](https://soundcloud.com/astro_naughtydog) | [Fawks](https://www.fawkstales.com/) | [Free Son](https://soundcloud.com/freesonmg) | [Jumpr](http://soundcloud.com/jump_r).`,
